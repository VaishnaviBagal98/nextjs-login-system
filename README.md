# Next.js Sign-In/Login Application
This is a simple Next.js application that implements user authentication through a sign-in/login page. 
Users can register, log in, and access routes. The application is built using NextJs ,React  and MongoDB, making it scalable and efficient.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
